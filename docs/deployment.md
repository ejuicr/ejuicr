# Deployment and operations

Operational notes for the ejuicr deployment. Last updated: October 2026.

## Production

- App: <https://ejuicr.vercel.app>
- Host: Vercel Hobby plan (free, personal/non-commercial use only — the
  donate link is a gray area for this clause).
- Repo: `github.com/ejuicr/ejuicr-next`, branch `master`. Vercel deploys on
  push automatically.
- Node.js is pinned to `22.x` via `engines` in `package.json`.
- Hobby gets a **single function region**; set it in Project Settings →
  Functions to the region nearest the Atlas cluster.
- Preview deployments use rotating URLs, so OAuth cannot complete there.
  Test auth on production.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pushes to any branch and on pull requests
to `master`: lint, typecheck, the unit/component suite, the database-backed
integration suite (MongoDB service container, test-only credentials), the
production build, and the Firefox smoke suite. The job is named `Validation`.

**Gating:** a repository branch ruleset (`master validation`) blocks branch
deletion and force pushes and requires the `Validation` status check on
`master`. The pull-request requirement is deliberately disabled. Rulesets
enforce required checks on the branch itself, so a commit without a passing
`Validation` run is rejected by `master`. Without pull requests, the workflow
is:

1. Push the commit to a branch (for example `ci/<change>`); CI runs there.
2. Wait for `Validation` to pass.
3. Push the same commit to `master`, or merge it through a pull request.

`scripts/push-gated.sh` automates that sequence (it requires an
authenticated `gh`): it pushes the current commit to `ci/gated-<sha>`, waits
for the check, pushes to `master`, and deletes the temporary branch.

Vercel deploys the resulting `master` push.

The prepared `Container image` job runs only on `master` pushes after `Validation`
passes. It builds a linux/amd64 image, smoke-tests it without production services,
then publishes `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:sha-<commit>` using the repository-scoped
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. The workflow summary reports the digest to use for an explicitly
approved host deployment. CI has no server credentials and never deploys Mothership.
This job is repository-authored; publication is not claimed until the updated
workflow is pushed and successfully runs.

Set repository **variables**, not secrets, for the intended public build values:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_DONATION_LINK`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL`, and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FEEDBACK_EMAIL`. Missing values hide the corresponding UI features.
These settings must be compared with Vercel before cutover; runtime environment
changes cannot replace values already compiled into the client bundle.

Image paths derive from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, so renaming `ejuicr-next` to `ejuicr`
can wait. A rename changes the path used by future publications; verify GHCR package
access/association and update host image references then. It does not rename an
existing package or change a running digest automatically.

## Prepared Mothership replacement

Production hosting is selected to move to `https://ejuicr.jimfarrugia.com`, replacing
Vercel while retaining production Atlas. This is not a completed cutover. Mothership's
`apps/ejuicr/README.md` and work ticket `006-ejuicr-production-hosting.md` own the host
configuration, approvals and apply/withdrawal procedure. Staging hosting and local
MongoDB are deferred separate work; keep the Vercel deployment and callbacks until
the replacement is verified and retirement is approved.

The Dockerfile uses Node 22 and enables Next's standalone output with
`NEXT_OUTPUT_STANDALONE=1`; ordinary Vercel/local builds keep `next start` support.
`.dockerignore` excludes
environment files, local dependencies and build/test artifacts. Never pass runtime
credentials as build arguments. An isolated local build and signed-out smoke test:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t ejuicr:local .
bash scripts/test-container.sh ejuicr:local
```

Pass the three `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` build arguments when preserving the production UI
settings. The smoke test starts only a disposable non-root container, without host
ports or real database/OAuth/mail credentials, and removes that exact container.
It checks the homepage, a static asset and signed-out API denial; it does not prove
database access, authenticated flows, TLS or reverse-proxy client-IP handling.
The host uses a reviewed digest, non-root UID/GID 1000, read-only root filesystem,
temporary writable `/tmp` and `/app/.next/cache`, and runtime-only credentials.
Production cookies require HTTPS and `APP_URL` must be the selected hostname.

## Environment mapping

| Environment       | Database             | `APP_URL`                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Local development | `ejuicr-development` | `http://localhost:3000`       |
| Vercel Production | `ejuicr-production`  | optional (see below)          |
| Vercel Preview    | `ejuicr-staging`     | not needed (uses `VERCEL_URL`)|

All three databases live in the same free Atlas M0 cluster
(`ejuicrcluster.m6bqbpe.mongodb.net`). Free-tier characteristics that matter:
512 MB storage, ~100 ops/sec, 500 connections, **no automated backups**, and
the cluster auto-pauses after 30 days with zero connections.

Atlas Network Access allows `0.0.0.0/0` because Vercel Hobby has no static
egress IPs. The database user is scoped to the ejuicr databases (avoid admin
users in Vercel).

`APP_URL` is optional on Vercel: `getAppUrl()` in `src/lib/url.ts` falls back
to `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` (stable production domain) and
`VERCEL_URL` (previews), then the request origin. It is still used for
password reset links and OAuth redirect URIs.

## Environment variables

Core (required): `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`.

Required for the features they enable:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` — Google sign-in (hidden when
  unset).
- `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` + `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET` — Twitter sign-in
  (hidden when unset).
- `EMAIL_ADDRESS` + `EMAIL_PASSWORD` — password reset emails. Without them,
  reset requests fail; email/password sign-in still works.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DONATION_LINK` — donation link on Contribute (the section is
  hidden when unset).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEEDBACK_EMAIL` — mail links on
  Help and Contribute (email text is omitted when unset).

`APP_URL` is optional on Vercel (see above); set it to the externally
reachable URL when hosting elsewhere.

- Values are in the git-ignored `.env.local` locally and in Vercel's project
  settings for deployments.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined at build time — set them before the
  build or redeploy afterward.
- Any Vercel env change needs a new deployment to take effect.
- `JWT_SECRET` must be a long random string (`openssl rand -base64 32`).
  Rotating it signs out every session. Session versioning also revokes old
  tokens whenever a password is set or changed.

## OAuth

### Google

- Client name **ejuicr-next** in the Google Cloud project **ejuicr-server**
  (project number `916930895724`), under the Google account that owns the
  `ejuicr-server`, `ejuicr-server staging`, and `ejuice-server development`
  projects.
- Authorized redirect URIs:
  - `https://ejuicr.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback`
  - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback`
- Flow: OAuth 2.0 authorization code, implemented in
  `src/lib/oauth/google.ts` and `src/app/api/auth/google/`.
- Console path: <https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients> (the older
  "APIs & Services → Credentials" page also works).
- Google can take 5 minutes to a few hours to apply redirect URI changes.
- A stale client from project `42289256841` exists in an old `.env` but
  belongs to an account we cannot access. **Do not use it.**

### X (Twitter)

- OAuth 1.0a via the `twitter-api-v2` package; implementation in
  `src/lib/oauth/twitter.ts` and `src/app/api/auth/twitter/`.
- Identify the app in the X developer portal by matching its **API Key**
  with `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`.
- Callback URIs:
  - `https://ejuicr.vercel.app/api/auth/twitter/callback`
  - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/twitter/callback`
- "Request email from users" must be enabled; the app rejects sign-in
  without an email (`authError=twitter-email`).
- If sign-in fails, `/api/auth/twitter` redirects to `/?authError=twitter`.
  To see X's exact error, call `generateAuthLink` locally with the callback
  URL; X's XML error message is logged by the route.

### Email

- Gmail SMTP over port 465 (`EMAIL_ADDRESS` + app password in
  `EMAIL_PASSWORD`). Vercel allows ports 465/587 and blocks only port 25.
- Verify credentials without sending mail via `transporter.verify()`.
- Password **reset** sends email; changing a password while signed in
  never does.

## Known quirks

- **Authentication and data invariants**: read `docs/DECISIONS.md` before
  changing auth, session, password, or uniqueness behavior.
- **Local dev DNS**: the LAN router (`192.168.50.1`) has a stale negative
  cache for the Atlas SRV record (from when the cluster was paused), so
  `querySrv ENOTFOUND` is returned even though public DNS resolves it. Fix
  by flushing/restarting the router DNS or using `1.1.1.1`/`8.8.8.8` on the
  dev machine. Temporary workaround: run a module that calls
  `dns.setServers(["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8"])` and start dev with
  `NODE_OPTIONS="--import /path/to/module.mjs" npm run dev`.
- **npm audit**: the five high advisories are a single dev-only chain
  (`eslint-config-next → fast-glob → micromatch → braces`,
  GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm) with no patched release. `npm audit --omit=dev`
  reports zero. Never run `npm audit fix --force` (it downgrades
  `eslint-config-next` to v14 and breaks the Next 16 lint setup).
- **Old infrastructure**: the old `ejuicr-server` backend and Vite front end
  are retired. The old backend had been down for 30+ days (proven by the
  Atlas auto-pause) and its GitHub Actions self-hosted runner is gone.
  Cleanup was deliberately skipped; nothing depends on it. The retired front
  end is still deployed at <https://ejuicr.netlify.app>: backend-dependent
  pages fail, but the calculator remains usable as a visual reference for UI
  parity. Update or remove this note if that deployment is taken down.

## Verification after any change

Run all of these locally:

```
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:integration   # in-memory MongoDB, or set MONGODB_TEST_URI
npm run build
```

`npm run test:integration` creates and drops its own temporary database; it
starts an in-memory MongoDB by default, or uses the isolated server in
`MONGODB_TEST_URI` when set. Never point that variable at development or
production. CI supplies a local MongoDB service container.

Then smoke-test production:

1. `GET /api/user/me` → 401 when signed out.
2. Register → `/api/user/me` → delete a throwaway account (201/200/200).
3. `GET /api/auth/google` → redirects to `accounts.google.com` with client
   project `916930895724` and the production callback.
4. `GET /api/auth/twitter` → redirects to `api.x.com` with an
   `oauth_token` and sets the request-token cookie.
5. In a browser: Google + X sign-in, save/view a recipe, settings
   persistence, change password, and password reset email end-to-end.

Read-only duplicate audit (exit code 2 means duplicates were found):

```
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/inspect-duplicates.mjs --database ejuicr-production
```

It also accepts `--database ejuicr-staging`. The audit covers recipe titles,
settings documents, and duplicate Google/Twitter provider IDs. Unique partial
indexes on `googleId`/`twitterId` (excluding empty and missing values) are in
the schema and are built by Mongoose on the first connection; run this audit
against any restored or migrated data before expecting the indexes to build.

## Backup and restore

Atlas M0 has **no automated backups**, so the maintainer owns a manual
routine. This section is the procedure, not an automated system: nothing here
runs on a schedule by itself.

- **Owner:** the maintainer (Jim Farrugia).
- **Cadence:** weekly, and before any risky migration or data change.
- **Storage:** gzipped `mongodump` archives in a directory outside the
  repository (for example `~/backups/ejuicr/`), on an encrypted disk. Never
  commit a dump.
- **Retention:** keep the eight most recent weekly archives (about two
  months). Delete older archives only after the new dump has been written
  successfully and verified as non-empty.
- A weekly dump also opens a connection, which helps prevent the free
  cluster's 30-day idle auto-pause.

### Weekly backup

Requires the MongoDB Database Tools (`mongodump`) locally and cluster access.
On Arch, install the AUR package `mongodb-tools`, or unpack the official
Linux tarball from <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools> and
put its `bin` directory on `PATH`.

The current database user has `readWriteAnyDatabase`, so it can create the
temporary restore database below. If that user is narrowed to the three
ejuicr databases, grant it access to the check database or restore into a
local MongoDB instead.

`.env.local` uses dotenv syntax, not shell syntax, and can contain characters
that break `source`. Extract the production URI with Node instead:

```sh
PROD_URI=$(node --env-file=.env.local -e \
  "console.log(process.env.MONGODB_URI.replace('/ejuicr-development','/ejuicr-production'))")
mkdir -p ~/backups/ejuicr
STAMP=$(date +%F)
mongodump --uri="$PROD_URI" --gzip \
  --archive="$HOME/backups/ejuicr/ejuicr-production-$STAMP.archive.gz"
```

Export staging the same way by replacing the database name. If the URI is
not based on `ejuicr-development`, substitute the cluster host and
credentials from `MONGODB_URI` manually.

### Restore check (quarterly, or after changing this procedure)

Restore the latest production archive into an isolated temporary database on
the same cluster, verify it, then drop the temporary database:

```sh
mongorestore --uri="$PROD_URI" --gzip \
  --archive="$HOME/backups/ejuicr/ejuicr-production-$STAMP.archive.gz" \
  --nsFrom="ejuicr-production.*" \
  --nsTo="ejuicr-restore-check-$STAMP.*"
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/inspect-duplicates.mjs \
  --database "ejuicr-restore-check-$STAMP"
```

Drop `ejuicr-restore-check-$STAMP` afterwards. `readWriteAnyDatabase` can
drop collections but not databases, so either drop the database in the Atlas
UI (project owner) or drop its collections without installing `mongosh`:

```sh
node --env-file=.env.local --input-type=module -e "
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI.replace('/ejuicr-development', '/ejuicr-restore-check-$STAMP'));
const db = mongoose.connection.db;
for (const collection of await db.listCollections().toArray()) {
  await db.dropCollection(collection.name);
}
await mongoose.disconnect();
"
```

The check is successful when the restore completes, the audit runs against
the restored database, and the document counts look plausible. Record it
below; the table must contain real checks, not planned dates.

| Date | Source archive | Restored database | Result | Verified by |
| ---- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 2026-10-05 | `ejuicr-production-2026-10-05.archive.gz` | `ejuicr-restore-check-2026-10-05` | 4 documents restored, 0 failures; duplicate audit clean (0 duplicate titles, settings, emails, or provider IDs) | Jim |

A full disaster recovery (restoring over `ejuicr-production` with
`mongorestore --drop`) is destructive and requires the maintainer's explicit
approval at the time.

## API compatibility

JSON field names deliberately match the legacy Express API (`_id`,
`base.pg`, `ingredients.nicotine`, ...). Existing data in the three
databases therefore works unchanged; do not rename fields in the models or
route responses without a migration plan.
