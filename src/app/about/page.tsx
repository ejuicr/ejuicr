        The goal of ejuicr is to a vaper&apos;s fist choice for a convenient and
        easy-to-use ejuice calculator.
      </p>
      <h2 className="section-heading">Use it Anywhere</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>If it can load a web page, it can run ejuicr.</p>
      <p>
        We try to keep the UI simple and unobtrusive so that you can use eJuicr
        easily whether you&apos;re reaching past a bunch of bottles for your
        keyboard or pecking at your phone with one hand and mixing juice with
        the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Install the web app to your desktop or home screen so you can even use
        ejuicr offline! <strong>(coming soon...)</strong>

        The faster you can start mixing, the better. So we try to remove as many
        speed bumps as possible.

        If you sign in, you can save your defaults (nicotine strength, PG/VG
        ratio, etc) to make mixing your ejuice even faster.
